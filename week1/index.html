                    <h2>Sound Waves</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sound travels in waves. We all know that. But what you may not know is that a sound wave is not your average wave. 
                        (Well, actually, based on sheer prevalence, it's probably fairly average, discounting light waves.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Usually when we think of a wave, we think of ocean waves and pond ripples, with a nice, even up-and-down sort of 
                        motion.:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <canvas id="transverse" width=1100 height=200></canvas>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is referred to as a <strong>transverse wave</strong>, and it's how plenty of waves work: water ripples, light 
                        waves, seismic waves, hand waves... But this is not how sound waves work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sound waves travel in <strong>longitudinal waves</strong>. In this type of wave, the kinetic enery of the wave 
                        vibrates along its length, running parallel to the wave's direction of travel, rather than perpendicular to it, as
                        it would in a transverse wave.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <canvas id="longitudinal" width=1100 height=100></canvas>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the case of a sound wave travelling through the air, the wave pushes and pulls the air around itself forward 
                        and backward with it, resulting in small pockets of <strong>pressurized</strong> air and <strong>rareified</strong>
                        (depressurized) spaces in between them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <canvas id="pockets" width="1100" height="300"></canvas>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These waves of pressurized and rareified air pockets are what our ears understand as <strong>sound</strong>.
                        Generally speaking, differently organized waves are heard as different sounds. Waves have many different 
                        properties that affect how we hear them. Two of the most important and best understood of these properties are
                        Frequency and Amplitude.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Frequency</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Frequency</strong> is the word we use to talk about how "large" these pockets of air are, so to speak, or
                        rather, how <em>frequently</em> they occur. Actually, to be more accurate, the word we use to talk about the size
                        or length of a pocket within a wave, specifically the distance from the beginning of one pocket to the beginning
                        of the next, is <strong>period</strong>. The period of a wave is actually the <em>inverse</em> of its frequency
                        (<span class="serif">1/f</span>). Point being, the longer each packet is (i.e. the larger its period), the less
                        <em>frequently</em> it occurs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="example">
                        <strong>Example:</strong> below are two waves. The bottom wave has 4 times the frequency of the first. (As it happens, the
                        two waves have frequencies of approximately 0.5Hz and 2 Hz, respectively; see below for more on the Hertz unit.)
                    </p>
                    <canvas id="lowfreq" width="1100" height="100"></canvas>
                    <canvas id="highfreq" width="1100" height="100"></canvas>
                    <p>
                        "But wait!" you cry, "What if the packets speed up or slow down? Surely this will affect frequency as well!" 
                        <strong>Wrong!</strong> Well, not actually wrong, because if they did speed up or slow down, that would definitely
                        affect frequency. But remember, <strong>the speed of sound is constant</strong> within a given medium (air, water,
                        dirt, drywall, chocolate-butterscotch-tapioca pudding). Since this never changes, a stream of air broken into
                        pressurized pockets at a certain regular distance apart will always collide with our eardrum at a steady interval.
                        Our ears use this measurement of how frequently they are being pounded to tell our brains what <strong>pitch</strong>
                        the sound has. Pitch, then, is essentially our brain's interpretation of the frequency of a sound wave. (There 
                        <em>are</em> certain other factors that will affect our perception of pitch, but frequency is far and away the 
                        primary factor.)

                    <aside>
                        <h3>aside:</h3>
                        <p>If you'll excuse a brief metaphor, imagine the following scene:</p>
                        <p>
                            A tennis ball machine has been set up to automatically spit tennis balls at an enormous bass drum leaning up
                            against a fence. The machine always spits them with the same amount of force, so they always travel the same
                            speed, but it has a knob that can be set to change how quickly the machine loads and new ball and spits it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, for some reason, this drum has been rigged up to an ancient telegraph machine from the 1850s. This machine
                            sends a "boop" each time a ball hits the drum, making for the least accurate ald least efficient form of
                            communication known to man. In this terrible analogy, three boops per second will send a different message to
                            the man at the other end of the telegraph than five boops per second or one boop per second.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now just imagine that the tennis balls are pressurized pockets of air, the machine is Mother Nature and/or a
                            source of sound, the drum is, well, an eardrum, the telegraph line is the inner ear or neurons or something,
                            and the guy at the other end is the brain, and hopefully you'll sort of see what I'm trying to say here.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (What's the fence, you ask? Yeah, I'm not sure... maybe ear hair?... Get off my back, I'm not Bill Nye.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Oh!</strong> By the way, we call this unit of one boop (or air pocket, or vibration) per second a <strong>Hertz (Hz)</strong>.
                            Three tennis-ball-boops per second is a 3Hz tennis-ball-drum-telegraph message.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Amplitude</h2>
                    <p>This one's easier and, I'm sure you'll be glad to know, much shorter.</p>
                    <p>
                        We've been talking about pressurized air pockets; <strong>Amplitude</strong> is the word we use to talk about
                        just how pressurized they are. The more powerful the vibrations generating the pressurized air packets, the more
                        pressurized the air packets will become, the more force they will carry with them, and the harder they will hit
                        our ear drums. Amplitude is often equated to how <strong>loud</strong> a sound is, and, while imperfect, it's
                        not a bad approximation. There are certain other factors that affect how loud our brains think a sound is, such
                        as ambient noise, other nearby sound sources, frequency (those high pitches are always so piercing!), and how
                        high we've turned up our hearing aids, but amplitude is usually the primary factor.
                    </p>
                    <p class="example">
                        <strong>Example:</strong> below are two waves. The bottom wave has 3 times the amplitude of the first.

                        <p>
                            To return breifly to our terrible metaphor, imagine now that the tennis ball machine is loaded up with, say,
                            baseballs, or rocks, or melons, or very fat chickens. (It has a variable sized barrel.) Any of these would
                            hit the drum significantly harder than the tennis balls when launched at the same speed, and since it's a
                            drum, the resulting "bang!" would consequently be much louder. Conversely, loading up the machine with
                            eggs, cotton balls, or little baby chickens (little <em>hypothetical</em> baby chickens; I have not tested
                            this, PETA) would most certainly result in a much softer sound.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (Yeah, yeah, I know, it's a telegraph... whatever, this one uses a microphone, so it'll be a louder or softer
                            boop or something, okay? You're not perfect either.)
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        A final note: the usual unit of measurement used to describe the amplitude of a wave is the <strong>Decibel (dB)</strong>.
                        Decibels get a bit tricky, though, because there are two ways to measure them. Remembering that amplitude, and
                        thus decibels, are a measurement of air pressure as a result of sound waves, the first is to measure them in
                        terms of how far above a standard low-end reference number the sound pressure of a wave is. The reference number
                        used is generally the accepted standard lowest level of amplitude a human can hear; this number is assigned 0dB.
                        This is generally how sounds are measured in the field. This type of decibel is often referred to as a
                        <strong>dBSPL</strong>, where SPL stands for Sound Pressure Level. The other common measurement is how far the
                        amplitude of the wave is below the the highest level a computer or sound system can handle without clipping and
                        causing distortion. These decibels are often referred to as <strong>dBFS</strong>, where FS stands for Full Scale.
                        In this measurement system, 0dB is the loudest the system can handle without clipping, and all other levels are
                        given negative decibels.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Independence!</h2>
                    <p>
                        Frequency and Amplitude, while they can each contribute to loudness and (to a lesser degree with amplitude) pitch,
                        are entirely independent beasts. What happened was, they used to be besties, you know, like five billion years
                        back, but then they got in a big fight over who was going to take Timbre to the big dance, and ever since then they
                        haven't been as close. For a while they didn't even talk. Now it's like, they'll work together, you know, for the
                        greater good of the universe and all, but they each pretty much do their own thing after 5pm. It's just not the
                        same any more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The point is, frequency and amplitude can (and usually do) change entirely independent of each other. Now, this
                        doesn't mean that they don't change simultaneously; this happens all the time. What it means is that they don't
                        <em>have</em> to, and when they do, their values aren't tied together in any way. When the frequency of a wave
                        increases, we can't make any new predictions about its amplitude as a result. It goes the other way, too; we can
                        change amplitude around all day long without frequency ever noticing (or caring, for that matter; and why should
                        frequency care who amplitude hangs out with, anyway? <small><em>It's just not the same...</em></small>).

                        To drive this whole thing home, let's play around a bit with a sound wave. The little mini-demo below will generate
                        a sine wave when the "Start Sound" button is pressed, and stop it when the "Stop Sound" button is pressed. The
                        sound played should match the wave shown and the values displayed below it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notice the two gray circles. These are handles: one changes frequency, the other changes amplitude. You can simply
                        play around with the values in silence, turn on the sound and move it around. It's up to you.

                            Note: You need a pretty new browser for this to work. It's currently tested and working in Mozilla Firefox and
                            Google Chrome, and it should work in Apple Safari as well. All other browsers are entirely untested, and I have
                            no idea whether they will work, though I'd love to find out.

                        So, to review, we've discussed Sound Waves, Frequency, and Amplitude.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Sound waves</strong> are longitudinal waves, meaning they oscillate forward and backward rather than up and down.</li>
                            <li>This front-to-back oscillation creates pockets of pressurized and rarified air at a certain <strong>frequency</strong>, which our ears interpret for our brains as sound at a certain <strong>pitch</strong>.</li>
                            <li>Similarly, the level of violence with which the source of the sound produces the waves determines the <strong>amplitude</strong> of the pressurized pockets of air, which in turn heavily influence our perception of the sound's <strong>loudness</strong>.</li>
                            <li>A system of communication based on a telegraph, a microphone, a large bass drum, and a tennis ball machine firing some assortment of balls, rocks, chickens, and other projectiles is a <strong>terrible idea</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>
